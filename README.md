#Umbrella

## Background & Overview

Umbrella is a mobile application that facilitates communication between parents and teachers.

In the modern day and age, parents face the increasingly difficult challenge of balancing work with personal life. Our vision is to create a service which helps busy parents keep track of their children's everyday moments and milestones and converse with teachers. In doing so, we hope to employ cutting-edge technologies in mobile development in order to bring families closer together.

Umbrella consists of 5 key components that work together to connect parents, teachers, and their children.

* Moments
* Photos
* Child profile and Milestones
* Parent and Teacher functionality
* Google Authentication
