#Umbrella

## Background & Overview

Umbrella is a mobile application that facilitates communication between parents and teachers.

In the modern day and age, parents face the increasingly difficult challenge of balancing work with personal life. Our vision is to create a service which helps busy parents keep track of their children's everyday moments and milestones and converse with teachers. In doing so, we hope to employ cutting-edge technologies in mobile development in order to bring families closer together.

Umbrella consists of 5 key components that work together to securely connect parents and teachers.

* Moments
* Photos
* Child profile and Milestones
* Parent and Teacher functionality
* Google Authentication

## Google Authentication

The privacy and security of our users is of utmost importance to us. That's why we protect our users with a two-part authentication process using Google OAuth2 and JSON Web Tokens.

Users can sign in to Umbrella using their Google+ account by tapping the "Sign in with Google" button.

It's easy, simple, and secure. Umbrella will never have access to the user's Google account. Instead, Google will verify the user's credentials and tell Umbrella to log you in.

**Google OAuth2**

OAuth is handled at the Rail backend using the Omniauth gem. Upon successful authentication, Google passes the server an `oauth_token`, which is saved to the user, and also passed back to Umbrella in the redirect URL.

**JSON WebToken Authentication**

Because the `oauth_token` in the URL carries the risk of being intercepted, it is not used to validate the user's session. Instead, Umbrella immediately submits it to the server to request a JSON Web Token, or JWT, delivered securely via HTTPS. The JWT is generated by encoding the user's `oauth_token` into the payload in order to create a JWT unique to that session. Now when the user makes any request, they must send a JWT to be decoded and validated.
```
class JsonWebToken
  # Encodes and signs JWT Payload with expiration
  def self.encode(payload)
    payload.reverse_merge!(meta)
    JWT.encode(payload, Rails.application.secrets.secret_key_base)
  end

  # Decodes the JWT with the signed secret
  def self.decode(token)
    JWT.decode(token, Rails.application.secrets.secret_key_base)
  end

  # Validates the payload hash for expiration and meta claims
  def self.valid_payload(payload)
    if expired(payload) || payload['iss'] != meta[:iss] || payload['aud'] != meta[:aud]
      return false
    else
      return true
    end
  end
  ...
end
```
Because only the server knows the `secret_key`, only it can decode and encode its JWTs, ensuring that the payload cannot be read or tampered with. Furthermore, the JWT can only be fetched once per session. This ensures that even if a `oauth_token` is captured, only the intended user can log in to that session. Upon logout, the user's `oauth_token` is destroyed, and will be replaced by a new token given by Google on the next sign in. This invalidates the JWT for that session for further security.
